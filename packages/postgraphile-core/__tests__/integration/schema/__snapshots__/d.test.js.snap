  The root query type must be a \`Node\` to work well with Relay 1 mutations. This just resolves to \`query\`.
  \\"\\"\\"
  nodeId: ID!

  \\"\\"\\"
  Exposes the root query type nested one level down. This is helpful for Relay 1
  which can only query top level fields if they are in a particular form.
